# What this is about

## Information

### I have re-arranged all the files scattered about into folders


- CSS folder
- HTML folder
- Images folder

### in order for vercel to be able to pick which one to show as html,

I had to *Put the other files inside separate folders* in order for vercel to know which one to display first
